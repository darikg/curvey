TODO
    SEARCH FOR TODOS IN CODE BSAE!
    SEARCH FOR CEMETERY IN CODE BASE

Janitorial TODOS:
    - isort, ruff, MYPY, etc.
    - Decide what to do about matplotlib imports
    - Pip install, etc
    - Reorder all of the properties so they're in some sane order
    - tests
    - Autodownload shapes dataset?
        - Could add a pooch dependency but who cares
    - separate environment.yml
        How to do [docs] [all] kinda install


subplots
    kinda hate the subtitle formatting
    default to one superplot?


API todo:
    - go over all the method names and make sure their consistent
        - sample, split, subdivide especially

    - external_angle_curvatures is so verbose
    A `nice` way of defining default curvature fn, tangent function, etc?
